 Arrrrr! Ahoy there matey!
 What brings ye to this humble island?
 ...
 Arrr? Me brother sent ye here, eh?
 Well blow me down! I didn't think that crazy scallywag even remembered me.
 ...Blasted landlubber still owes me that drink.
 ...
 Ah! So he lost those little bubbles of his again, eh?
 Arthur never could keep track of anything...
 That lily-livered landlubber loses stuff all the time, it's no suprise.
 ...
 Well it's awfully hard to hold on to stuff, when ye got no arms.
 Anywho, I'm sure ye want me help with finding his loot.
 ...
 Yes I've seen them billowing all over! To be honest they're an eyesore.
 I'd start right behind me house there, atop those pillars.
 One word of advice though, mind the waters here.
 One step in there and you'll be sleeping in Davy Jones' locker.
 Oh! and there's been sightings of some strange looking fish finding there way up here on the island.
 I swear I don't even know what's going on around here anymore...
 No matter! I'm sure you've got this! Heave-ho, shiver me timbers n all that!
